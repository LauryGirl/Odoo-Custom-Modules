product bugs introduced by recent UC! Web or UC! Server code changes):
a. Priority #1: Latest Smoke with recent Edge Browser version
b. Priority #2: Latest Smoke with recent Chrome Browser version
c. Priority #3: Latest Regression with recent Edge Browser version
d. Priority #4: Latest Regression with recent Chrome Browser version
2. Maintain the UC! Web Smoke and Regression test suites in the event something is identified by Bobby as needing to be added or changed</p>

Project: Art/Research Website
Description: <p>We are looking for a skilled full-spec or back end web developer to create a website that will showcase an art and research project that focuses on sites visited by a federal government photography program in the 1930's. This art project intends to support contemporary coverage of the sites/issues covered by the program.

The site will feature an interactive map of the United States with geotags for locations visited by the photography program. When clicked, each geotag will take users to a page with information about the original photographic coverage conducted by the government in the area. If the site has been covered by a contemporary photographer, it will also show their coverage. If it hasn't, it will prompt visitors to conduct their own coverage of the site. Essentially, this website should be able to house many images and short essays on different pages and support submissions from site visitors that can be edited and approved for upload to the site by a site administrator.

A front-end developer will be available to help develop the look of the site and supervise the project. What we are really in need of is someone to build the bones of the website and work with him to make it look visually appealing.

Size: Medium
Duration: 1 to 3 months
Expertise: Intermediate

Knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript etc. is required. Experience with content management systems is a major plus. We are open to suggestions and ideas from the developer to enhance the website's functionality and user experience.</p>
